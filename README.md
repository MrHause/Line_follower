## Overview
The aim of the project was to build an automotive platform which follow the black line. First of all has been built a platform with 2 DC motors and 4 IR sensors which detect the black line on the floor.
For control DC motors has been used a H-bridge and as power supply a Li-Ion battery. The main part is a STM32F1 microcontroler with 72MHz clock. In this repository can be found all project built in
SW4STM (System workbech for STM) written in C programming language.
